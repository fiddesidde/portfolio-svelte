This is a SSR app I made during the course of ["The Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) primarily to learn authentication and authorization.The app is a messaging
board where, depending on the users "tier", different information is available
to view and actions to take.

The technology used is:

- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- EJS
- Bootstrap

The app is hosted on a RaspberryPi, same as this site, running Ubuntu Server with
an NGINX reverse proxy.

Go ahead and try the app. Use the passphrase "banana" to upgrade the user tier to "Member" status.
